Attack On Titan Text Adventure

This text adventure game is based on Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2. You must reach the basement, take all three books, and reach the sea without dying. You can access the list of all the commands and their functions with the 'help' command, as well as look at the world map using the 'map' command at any time.
(The map in the game is slightly different from the map.png).

In this game, you start in Trost District, and as you progress through the game, new game areas will unlock. To keep the story going however, some game areas that you've already visited may get locked for you to progress through the story. Eventually,
the entire game world will be free to explore once you've gotten at least one of the books from the basement. At the start of the game, you must get the ODM gear and basement key from Eren's room. The ODM gear is required to traverse through certain parts of the map.
You must also sleep there to recharge your titan transformations. Next you'll go to Wall Rose, where you'll mount your horse then go into the Titan Forest. Next, you'll mount your horse there, then use your ODM gear to get onto Wall Maria's outer gate, while also having 
to avoid the dormant titan. Once you get onto Wall Maria, you'll then go to the outer gate, where you seal the wall by first transforming, then hardening. If you sealed the wall, then the Armoured Titan should spawn in Shiganshina District, in which you'll use your ODM gear
to get down there. Next, you'll attack the Armoured Titan by first transforming, then hardening. If you are hardened then you'll defeat him, otherwise you'll die. Next, the Colossal Titan spawns in Shiganshina, whom you should attack immediately after defeating the Armoured 
Titan. He'll kick you onto Wall Maria, where Armin will tell you his plan to defeat him. Next, you should fall down to Shiganshina where you'll harden to seal Wall Maria's outer gate (causing you to become human again) then use your ODM gear to attack the Colossal Titan and
defeat him. You'll then be prompted to choose whether to save Armin or Erwin. Choosing either will make the basement available. Next, go to the basement and use the basement key to go inside (the key doesn't work but Levi kicks the door open). Go inside the basement, then use
the basement key to unlock the locked desk drawer to access the three books. Getting one will make the entire game world accessible. Next, go to the sea with all three books to win the game.
